- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Dena Aulia, but you simply refer me as Ms. Dena.
- I am an experienced English teacher with over two years of teaching diverse groups of students, ranging from preschoolers to adults. My passion for education and dedication to student success has driven me to develop and implement engaging lesson plans that cater to various learning styles. I specialize in teaching English as a comprehensive set of skillsâ€”listening, speaking, reading, and writingâ€”as well as providing targeted instruction for academic and business English. Additionally, I prepare students to achieve specific scores on standardized tests, ensuring they meet their academic and professional goals.

In my teaching career, I have consistently received positive feedback for my ability to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment. My technical proficiency with online teaching platforms like Zoom, Google Classroom, and Microsoft Teams enables me to conduct seamless virtual classes. Equipped with a reliable high-speed internet connection, a powerful laptop, a high-definition webcam, and high-quality headphones, I am well-prepared to deliver high-quality remote instruction. My commitment to professional growth is reflected in my strong academic background, including a GPA of 3.65 and a TOEFL Simulation score of 623.

My current earning rate is IDR 65,000 per hour, which aligns with my expectations for future opportunities. I am excited to bring my skills, experience, and passion for teaching to a new role, where I can continue to inspire and support students in their language learning journey. Thank you for considering my application.
